# this how mosh likes to organize his import statements.
    1. first we import stuff from the react.
    2. then we import stuff from the 3rd party library.
    3. then finally our own import statements.

# we will talk about 'providers' in next part of the course where we talk about more advance topics.    

# notes : Every time mosh writes a bit of code. Before committing his changes he always reviews his code/changes in the source control tab of vs code.
To make sure he has not made any mistake. to see if he has any opportunity to cleanup his code 


# Always work on a small piece of functionality. Make sure it works then move on to next step. 
Don't try to do too many things at once


# Currently GameGrid component is involved in making http request. Currently knows type of request that we are making and knows about our endpoints.
and future will also know of cancelling request using abort controller.
This is something we don't want in our component. Because our 
'component should be primarily responsible for returning markup and handling user interaction at high level'.

Here we have 2 options 

1) One way is to move logic for making http-request inside a service. (as we did in previous chapter)
2) The other option is to move the entire logic (meaning state variables and useEffect) into a custom hook. 
Hooks are not necessarily for sharing functionality across different components. We can also use them to separate concerns and make our code more 
modular and reuseable
