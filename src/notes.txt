# this how mosh likes to organize his import statements.
    1. first we import stuff from the react.
    2. then we import stuff from the 3rd party library.
    3. then finally our own import statements.

# we will talk about 'providers' in next part of the course where we talk about more advance topics.    

# notes : Every time mosh writes a bit of code. Before committing his changes he always reviews his code/changes in the source control tab of vs code.
To make sure he has not made any mistake. to see if he has any opportunity to cleanup his code
